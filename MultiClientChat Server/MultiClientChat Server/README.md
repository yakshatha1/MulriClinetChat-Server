In the Client part of the project, `client/Main.java` plays a crucial role. Here are the details of its implementation:

- `client/Main.java` is responsible for the client-side of the application. It uses the Socket class to initiate a connection to the server, specifying the IP address and port number.

- This class utilizes the Scanner to collect user input and sends this data to the server using the PrintWriter object, facilitating the transmission of messages from the client to the server.

- It ensures smooth and interactive communication between the client and the server, allowing users to input messages and send them to other clients via the server.

- `client/Main.java` is an integral component of the project, enabling users to participate in the client-server model for real-time communication.
